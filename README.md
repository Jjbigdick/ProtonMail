### Key Achievements  
- 99% Success Rate via custom pixel analysis.  
- Solves 8 CAPTCHAs (one machine) in parallel with Python multiprocessing.  
- Completed stealth via proxy rotation.
  
### Features  
- **Jâ€™s Detection Algorithm** (self-built ProtonMail solver)  
- **Multi-CAPTCHA Parallel Solving**  
- **Anti-Detection Engine** (IP rotation and mouse obfuscation)  
- **Computer Vision Pipeline** (OpenCV + brute-force detection)  

### Technical Stack  
- Python, Selenium, OpenCV, Proxy APIs, 2Captcha API  

### Why This Project?  
- Solves a real-world challenge in automating secure email account creation.  
- Demonstrates reverse-engineering, performance optimization, and anti-detection strategies.
- 
### Future Roadmap  
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Train a CNN for adaptive CAPTCHA solving (reduce brute-force reliance).  
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Extend solver to reCAPTCHA v3 and Cloudflare Turnstile.
